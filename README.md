Practice using Boolean expressions
Practice reading code/improving code literacy with while loops/infinite loops
Practice writing for loops
Practice using the terminal
create files, move files, copy files, remove files
create directories, move directories, remove directories
Prerequisites
An introduction to JavaScript
An introduction to Terminal
Getting Started
Create a folder named first_homework somewhere convienent, like your Desktop
Create a file inside that folder called first_js_homework.js (this file should contain all your answer for the Javascript questions)
Create a file inside that folder called terminal_homework.bash (this should contain all the commands you used during the terminal exercise)
Deliverables
Answer the questions, write some code and submit the files via slack (see instructions at the bottom). Note: there are 5 Sections in this homework

Technical Requirements
The JavaScript file MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong
The bash file should just be the commands you ran, copy and pasted into the file. A template is provided in the file first_hw_bash_instructions.bash, you can copy and paste that into your file and add your commands below each comment
Submission Guidelines
Must be submitted before the next class day, (ie no later than 10am EST) - if you have problems submitting reach out ~15 minutes before the start of class
Tonight we'll be submitting via slack, since we don't have our github set up completely. See instructions below

Terminal Cheatsheet
Section 1
Terms
For any answers that require a written response, write the response as commented-out code

// 1. The difference between interpolation and
// concatentation is . . .
Write these answers in first_js_homework.js

Remember:

Run your file by typing node first_js_homework.js
Then, press the up arrow to retrieve the node first_js_homework.js command after you have used it the first time, instead of typing it out every single time
Answer:

What does the acronym DRY stand for? Why should we pay attention to it? What programming tools have we learned to write DRY code?

What is the difference between const and let and var? Please limit your answer to no more than three short sentences. Don't be afraid to research using google and other resources


Section 2
Boolean expressions
Video on Booleans if you need review
... and variable assignment

Code:

Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks (underscores) with a mathematical or boolean operator that evaluates the expression to true (some may have more than one right answer, just choose one)
Test your answers by using console.log for each expression in your answer file.
  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kelvin';
  const f = false;
a _ b

c _ d

'Name' _ 'Name'

a _ b _ c

a _ a _ d

e _ 'Kevin'

48 _ '48'

f _ e

Set a new variable g to 0

console.log g

Then set the variable g to be equal to b + c

console.log g

Answer:

Did you use const, let or var? Why did you choose the one you chose?
What happens if you don't use const , let or var? Do you get an error? If so what does it say?
what happens if you write 10 = g?
Bonus Challenge (optional): Replace the underscores to make a Boolean expression that evaluates to true. Use no more than one of the following: > , < !== and ===.

a _ (b || f) _ !f && e _ c
Bonus hint


Section 3
While loops
Video on Loops if you want review
Increase your code literacy by reading code, line by line.

Infinite loop?
Read the following code very carefully.

DO NOT RUN the code because it might run an infinite loop

Infinite loops can sometimes be hard to stop and may require you to reboot your computer. Being able to determine whether you've created an infinite loop before running your code is a handy skill to have

Answer:

Is the code below an infinite loop? Why or why not?
Don't worry about getting it 'wrong' - you'll be graded on your reasoning, not if your ultimate answer is correct.
You should NOT test (run) this code, so read it line by line and 'execute' the code in your head.

while (true) {
	console.log('Do not run this loop');
}
Infinite loop II
is this loop an infinite loop? Why or why not?
const runProgram = true;

while (runProgram) {
	console.log('Do not run this loop');
	runProgram = false;
}
Answer:

Infinite or not infinite? What is the expected output?

Reading code
Ok rest easy, no more infinite loops for now!

The following while loop uses a compound assignment operator, i.e. +=

Without running this loop, what is the expected output?

Read the code line by line-- everything happens in sequence. Write down what you think the code will log in the Terminal by adding comments before each line of code, explaining what that line of code will do. Be patient with your thought! There is no rush.

Example:

let q = 20;

// start a while loop that will run as long as q is greater than 10
while (q > 10){
  // prints the value of q to the screen/Terminal window
  console.log(q)
  // decrements the value of q by 1
  q--
// closes the while loop, the code inside this loop will keep running until the while condition is evaluated to false
}
Code:

let letters = "A";
let i = 0;

while (i < 20) {
	letters += "A";
	i++;
}

console.log(letters);
Copy the above code into your .js file
Add a comment for each line, like the above example
Write a comment with your expected result
Run the code
Write another sentence confirming whether the code was what you expected. If it isn't what you expected, don't change what you wrote about your expected result. Rather write one sentence explaining what you learned. Remember the goals are to learn how to code, how to think critically, how to fix bugs, and learn from mistakes. Try to adapt to the growth mindset (Bonus reading)

Section 4
For loops
Answer:

A for loop performs the same operation as a while loop. But what are the key differences, if any? What are the similarities?
For loop control panel
Here is an example for loop that prints a message 100 times:

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	console.log('Without you, today\'s emotions are the scurf of yesterday\'s');
}
Answer:

What are the three components of the control panel? Each component is separated by a semicolon ;.

Remember: Write your answers as comments in the file.

The first part of the control panel is:
The second part of the control panel is:
The third part of the control panel is:
For loop II
Write a for loop that will console.log the numbers 0 to 999.

Bonus Challenge (optional):

What is the difference between \ (backslash, above the enter/return key) and / (forward slash or just slash, shares the key with the ?)? What is \ doing in the string?

  console.log('Without you, today\'s emotions are the scurf of yesterday\'s');
  console.log("Without you, today's emotions are the scurf of yesterday's");
For loop in reverse
Code:

Using a postfix operator i-- instead of i++, write a for loop that iterates in reverse. Console.log a countdown from 999 to 0.

More counting
Write a for loop that uses string concatenation to send a message to the console as well as the current value of i.

The loop should run from 1 to 10.

Expected Result:

The value of i is: 1 of 10
The value of i is: 2 of 10
The value of i is: 3 of 10
The value of i is: 4 of 10
The value of i is: 5 of 10
The value of i is: 6 of 10
The value of i is: 7 of 10
The value of i is: 8 of 10
The value of i is: 9 of 10
The value of i is: 10 of 10
Bonus Challenge (optional):

Rewrite the above loop using String Interpolation/Template Literals instead of concatenation

Note: string interpolation uses backticks, this is a different character than a single quote. The backtick can usually be found above the left tab key/below the esc key and it shares it with the tilda ~

Iteration
const StarWars = ["Han", "C3PO", "R2D2", "Luke", "Leia", "Anakin"];
Iterate over the StarWars array and print each element to the console.

Iterate over the StarWars array again and print each character's name as well as the value of i.

Bonus Challenge (optional):

Figure out how to iterate over every second element of the StarWars array, starting with the first element.
=> Han, R2D2, Leia


Section 5
Terminal Practice
Write the answer to each command at the bottom your terminal_homework.bash You can copy a template of each command prompt from the first_bash_instructions.bash file and then copy paste your answers below each prompt

Episode X: A New Terminal
A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

You can do each prompt/command one by one or

Bonus Challenges (Optional)

Try doing the following:

Try applying one command to multiple files at once.
Try applying one command to all files in a single directory (where necessery)
Try applying one command to all files that match a pattern.
Find and use command line shortcuts.
Try using a mix of absolute and relative paths (there is a section on absolute pathing in today's Terminal lesson markdown).
Part I: Set the Scene
Code and Copy your working code into the terminal_homework.bash file

Open the Terminal app

Create a new directory on your Desktop called galaxy_far_far_away and enter it via terminal

Create a directory called death_star, and make the following files inside of it:

darth_vader.txt
princess_leia.txt
storm_trooper.txt
In galaxy_far_far_away, make a directory named tatooine and create the following files in it:

luke.txt
ben_kenobi.txt
Inside of tatooine make a directory called millenium_falcon, and in it create:

han_solo.txt
chewbaca.txt

Part II: mv - rename
You can rename a file using the mv command.

For example, rename file1.txt to file2.txt

mv file1.txt file2.txt
Rename ben_kenobi.txt to obi_wan.txt.

Part II: cp - copy
You can copy a file from one location to another using the cp command.

For example, copy file1.txt to its parent directory:

cp file1.txt ..
And, copy file1.txt to a sibling directory:

cp file1.txt ../some_directory
Finally, copy file1.txt to a child directory:

cp file1.txt some_directory
Copy storm_trooper.txt from death_star to tatooine

Part IV: mv - move
You can use the mv command to move files from one location to another

For example, move a file from its current location to the parent directory:

mv file1.txt ..
And, move a file from its current location to a sibling directory:

mv file1.txt ../some_directory
Finally, move a file from its current location to a child directory:

mv file1.txt some_directory
You can also move directories into other directories using the same syntax

Move luke.txt and obi_wan.txt to the millenium_falcon

Move millenium_falcon out of tatooine and into galaxy_far_far_away

Move millenium_falcon into death_star

Move princess_leia.txt into the millenium_falcon


Part V: rm - remove
You can use rm to delete a file.

For example, delete a file:

rm file1.txt
Delete obi_wan.txt

Part VI: all together
In galaxy_far_far_away, make a directory called yavin_4

Move the millenium_falcon out of the death_star and into yavin_4

Make a directory in yavin_4 called x_wing

Move princess_leia.txt to yavin_4 and luke.txt to x_wing

Move the millenium_falcon and x_wing out of yavin_4 and into galaxy_far_far_away

In death_star, create directories for tie_fighter_1, tie_fighter_2 and tie_fighter_3

Move darth_vader.txt into tie_fighter_1

Make a copy of storm_trooper.txt in both tie_fighter_2 and tie_fighter_3

Move all of the tie_fighters out of the death_star and into galaxy_far_far_away


Part VII: rm -r - remove directories
Be careful with this command - cannot undo!

Make sure you delete the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).

This command will typically not ask you if you really want to delete. It will just delete . . .

Remove tie_fighters 2 and 3.
Part VIII: The Final Act
Touch a file in x_wing called the_force.txt

Destroy the death_star and anyone inside of it.

Return x_wing and the millenium_falcon to yavin_4

Celebrate!



Hungry for More
With every homework, we'll add a challenge section that is optional. These sections will help you grow and solidify concepts. Homework should take about 4 hours, if you have completed hw in less than 4 hours you are strongly encouraged to work on this section. If homework is taking longer than 4 hours, it is better to skip this section and rest so you are ready for the next day

Read about Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

Explore online resources like Eloquent JavaScript


Homework submission
Tomorrow we'll spend more time with Git and how to use it for homework submission. For tonights homework just create a new github gist (think of it as a one file git repo) and copy and paste your work into there and then submit the link via the homework submission form which should be linked on the class website and bookmarked in the classroom slack channel
